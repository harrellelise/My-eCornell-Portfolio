This is my final project for my Machine Learning Foundations course. I created a Machine Learning Model to predict the price of booking per night of Airbnb's using a random forest model. I have not shared the dataset here as it is a private data set. 
I prepared the data using one hot encode, along with winsorizing any missing values or large outliers. 
I weighed my features using stepwise feature selection as well as tweaking the hyperparameters usings a grid search.
